            <div class="post-content">
                <p>As a Resident Assistant (RA) at Penn State, one of my key responsibilities is organizing and executing programming events that enhance the residential experience for my fellow students. In this blog post, I'll share my journey of planning and implementing these events, the challenges I've faced, and the valuable lessons I've learned along the way.</p>

                <h2>What is RA Programming?</h2>
                <p>RA programming involves creating and organizing events that promote community building, academic success, and personal growth among residents. These events can range from social gatherings to educational workshops and cultural celebrations.</p>

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>Throughout my time as an RA, I've organized various events including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating Door Decs</li>
                    <li>Oktoberfest</li>
                    <li>Mario Kart Tournament</li>
                    <li>Karoke Night</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Reason</h2>
                <p>The reason that we plan and host these events is to create a sense of community and belonging within the floor and the building.
                    And the best way to accomplish this is to create fun events that they want to come to and participate. These events are also a great way to 
                    connect with my floor residents and more importantly, for them to connect with each other and form new relationships.</p>


                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>My experience as an RA has been invaluable in developing both professional and personal skills. The opportunity to create and execute programming has taught me lessons that I'll carry forward into my future career in tech.</p>
