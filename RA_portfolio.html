                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Fazlemalak Chimthanawala, a passionate gamer, reader, and aspiring sarcasm master. 
                    Coming from India, I aim to experience and participate in every single activity here in America.

                <h2>What is an RA?</h2>
                <p>An RA is more than a resource for residents; they are mentors, community builders, and advocates for personal growth. 
                    As an RA, I aim to be a supportive presence, ensuring residents feel valued and connected.</p>
    
                <h2>Strengths</h2>
                <p>My top 5 Clifton Strengths are Command, Competition, Input, Significance and Ideation.
                    I love being in charge, learning more about new things and I want to work on stuff that makes a difference.
                    My personality type is ENTP and zodiac sign is Leo. My ENTP personality type is Debater and I love playing 
                    Devil's Advocate whenever possible.
                    My greatest strengths are leading others, learning and want to work on important stuff.
                </p>

                <h2>Community Builder (CB) Statement</h2>
                <p>Community Builders are essential for fostering trust and camaraderie. 
                    During an Oktoberfest event that I was a part of organizing, I saw a lot of people
                    come together, enjoy some good food, drink apple cider and paint a pumpkin.</p>

                <h2>Student Development Theory</h2>
                <p>I believe that student development thrives in environments of constructive pressure and competition. 
                    After all, pressure forms diamonds. But fun is also equally important to enjoy life.
